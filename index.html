            Aryabhata is considered as the first of the major mathematician-astronomers
            from the classical age of Indian mathematics and Indian astronomy. 
            Following an introduction that contains astronomical tables and 
            Aryabhata's system of phonemic number notation in which numbers 
            are represented by a consonant-vowel monosyllable, the work is 
            divided into three sections: 
            <i>Ganita (“Mathematics”), Kala-kriya 
                (“Time Calculations”), and Gola (“Sphere”).</i>
            In <i>Ganita </i>Aryabhata names the first 10 decimal places and gives algorithms 
            for obtaining square and cubic roots, using the decimal number system. 
            With <i> Kala-kriya</i> Aryabhata turned to astronomy—in particular, treating 
            planetary motion along the ecliptic.
            Aryabhatta finally ends with spherical astronomy in <i>Gola</i>, where he applied plane 
            trigonometry to spherical geometry by projecting points and lines on the 
            surface of a sphere onto appropriate planes.
